``drawnow`` for matplotlib
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Matlab has a great feature where it allows you to update a figure. You can
simply call `drawnow` and have your figure update. This is nice if you're
running a simulation and want to see the results every iteration. It'd sure be
nice if Python/matplotlib had a similar feature to update the plot each
iteration. This package adds that functionality to matplotlib.

This readme is probably out of date; a more complete file is on Github.

Usage:
    
.. code:: python

    from drawnow import drawnow

    x = zeros((N,N))

    def function_to_draw_figure():
        #figure() # don't call, otherwise new window opened
        imshow(x)
        #show()   # don't call show()!

    ion() # enable interactivity (can be default)
    figure()
    for i in arange(x):
        x.flat[i] = 1
        drawnow(function_to_draw_figure)

If you want to wait for confirmation after update, call ``drawnow(function_to_draw_figure, confirm=True)``.

If you only want to show the figure once, call
``drawnow(function_to_draw_figure, show_once=True)``

Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Two options:

1. Download this repository and run `python setup.py install`.
2. Run ``pip install drawnow``.
